# W3F Grant Proposal 

- **Project Name:** Fair Squares
- **Team Name:** FS
- **Payment Address:** //TODO DAI(agreed)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

  Fair Squares aims is to co-create a more transparent and fair housing market for tenants, co-owners and social investors. In order to make rental housing more affordable and accessible to a larger group of people.


- Project Description.

The fair squares will be programmed to stick to a return-on-rent which will be a global variable, this will bridge the affordable housing gap. A group of individuals, each bundling their capital to invest in a house that is for sale, with the purpose to rent it out. Based on their individual fractional share of the house they will get a yield which is the social return-on-rent.
In order to create affordable housing, while offering investors a better return compared to other defensive investments. The community agrees on the capped yield, which controls the rent and keeps it affordable. These parameters are governed by the council and stakeholders that strive for a fair housing market.  
By using Web3 technology in a semi-permissionless system for real-world assets, digital currencies and decision making we lower the barrier to entry to invest in the housing market and make it transparent and equitable. 

- Integration into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

The Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem allows us to use the required building blocks through the relay-chain. The substrate framework gives us the runtime to be very specialized and bring out a protocol that does like clockwork to onboard assets and rent them out. The already open-sourced frame pallets and community work helps out a lot in this. 
Because of the social mission and required actions on-chain we want a feeless parachain while getting the security from the relay-chain. We are looking to collaborate and use parachain services for DIDs, stablecoins, storage protocols within the substrate web3 ecosystem. In order to combine the real word with assets, by a solid permissioned process and still connected to para and relaychain.

- Team Motivativation.

It is exciting to see all of these kinds of similar DeFi and bridging protocols and platforms evolve. We as a team are users and believe there is not turning back from this. Nevertheless we as Fair Squares are seeing the negative social economical consequences for the low and middle class even in developed countries. For us blockchain technology was a bigger game-changer and had more woven fibers into the real-world. We want people to still earn returns on their investments, but stop the profit maximization mechanisms on basic needs. 


### Project Details

We are looking to develop a first usable open-sourced version of the fair-squares node and interface. We have been already hacking since September 2021 on the code-base while participating to the APAC hackathon. 

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
  - video front-end mock-up: https://youtu.be/_8mnawfNpBQ
  - code: //TODO @Stephen
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
  - //TODO update kazu's version
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
  - Substrate node template + own pallets
  - front-end template connected through WS 
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
  - //TODO Docusaurus... @Ilhan and Team
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - We are not aiming for an immediate parachain or live application. We are aiming for a live testnet, where a lot more testing, experimenting and interaction with other parachains are required to happen after the completed milestones. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
   - Looking at kusama & polkadot there are more and more specialized parachains coming live. We want to make use of these functions such as stable tokens, DIDs/ID, storage, privacy and/or messaging. We want to focus on creating a protocol and platform that focuses on solving affordable housing. It would be a niche idea in the substrate ecosystem, it has a social good focus with coordination of funds and actions in which we can automate the flow in the runtime.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - The target audience for using the developed pallets are the end-users such as investors, sellers, verifiers, oracles. The current mid-term goal is to further research and experiment. We are in talks with several institutions in the Netherlands that we rely on for a functional application for affordable housing. Our goal is to get into a functional MVP that can handle a case and learn from the short comings of doing this and the pros. This will help us gather information about the limitations of interactions between Blockchain and real-world processes, and devise additional solutions.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - FS project focuses is on utilizing the available building blocks that are known in the cryptosphere to make affordable housing possible with maximum transparancy possible. The real world integration with blockchains are still minimal. We have payments for physical goods, but nothing really interacting with the real world, business and retailers. We believe that crypto systems implementation will look very different 5-10 years from now, and we aim at becoming pioneers of this new evolution, while maintaining the important elements in a blockchain, distribution of power, equitable systems for future users.    

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - No projects we aware of that are focusing on housing and/or real estate. There are however big parts of our design heavily inspired by the design of the governance layers in Kusama / Polkadot and Phragmén method for allocating funds in an asset. 
  - Outside of substrate based ecosystems there are a couple of real estate projects, maybe the most notable is RealT, but it just focuses on the return of rental houses, where the LLC takes care of everything on the background and users just see their tokens and returns.

### Team's experience

The idea of Fair Squares and work has been existing for 2 years. We wrote a light-paper to put things on paper and develop our idea further on paper. After that finished we decided to publish the idea in a hackathon to get some exposure and experience. 

The team that stuck after the APAC hackathon (Ilhan & Kazu). The majority of the team has limited experience in developing with Rust and Substrate. After finishing the hackathon we had a much more clear idea of what we needed in terms of skills. After the hackathon Stephen joined us. 


- __Ilhan__: has experience with different blockchain development architectures. During his time with the Blocklab.nl (a innovation arm /subsidiary of the Port Authorities in Rotterdam) he has created different applications for Energy and Supply-chains using a decentralized stack. He was also a part of the first cohort runtime developers academy. Active member in Kusama / Polkadot blockchains governance and validating. 
- __Kazu__: Engineer in mechanical design at Fuji Electric. He started studying Rust in August 2021 and participated in 3 hackathons (2 with Polkadot and 1 with Phala) between August and November 2021. Most of what he has done can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ndkazu).  The first original program written with Rust is demonstrated in this [video](https://youtu.be/sMpUnaz_AiY)
- __Stephen__: Is a software engineer with experience mainly in .net environment, web app and desktop applications for different clients in banks, health and sport. He started to learn Rust in December with the objective to help concretize the project with his development skills according to the roadmap that we will define further. 
- __Mahir__: is responsible for the market part of the FS research and the pilots with municipalities and other stakeholders. He is involved as an entrepreneur and consultant in various IT solutions such as [unlocQed](https://www.unlocQed.com) (honest recruitment) and works on Weconomics Blockchain projects and is responsible for research, design and valorization.

The team together has only been working on fair squares and has not applied for other Web3F grants.

## Development Status :open_book:

- We started of with publishing a [light-paper](https://fair-squares.nl/lightpaper/fair/squares/2021/09/14/english_whitepaper.html). To bring light to the problem and structure the idea. We have interviewed 4 organisations about these research questions in our light-paper that we thought needed to be enlightened. The link to the research results can be found here //TODO 
- We have presented our project at amsterDOT conference, the link for the video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/rZdqHgn69wU)
- We have discussed this project with several members of the polkadot community. We talked about it couple of times with Raul wether a treasury proposal would be good, we didn't go for this as we saw a lot of non-related projects to Kusama of Polkadot neccesarily being rejected by the council.

- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2
- **Total Costs:** 36000 USD

### Milestone 1 — Implement module roles, fund and role-verifiers 

- **Estimated duration:** 6 weeks
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 6,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can spin up the fs-node and how the housing-fund and  will show how the new functionality works and how to use the functions.|
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains the roles modules. In which a user can register on-chain with minimal information and participate in the fair-squares platform |
| 1. | Substrate module: Roles | We will create a Substrate module in which users can set their roles when they register, for now this will be a single role and in the future these could be multiple roles by merge identities together. They can choose between investor, seller, tenant,   | 
| 2. | Substrate module: __Housing Fund__ | We will create a Substrate module in wich users can desposit and withdraw their funds. This fund registers which `accountId`, `amount`, the `blocknr` and other variables such as the `total_contribution` per user whether a user has `withdrawn` their funds. These storages will be used further in next modules for the selection of investors. The housing fund allocate if it has the funds to bid for an asset, so it also needs a function to allow the bidding mechanism to withdraw the amount to reserve it out of the housing fund and eventually in a happy flow transact for the asset. |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Role-verifier | This module will focus institutions that will verify users. We need to comply with legislation and if a user is going to for this part we are looking in the future | 
| 4. | Substrate chain | For this milestone we are trying to create the housing fund, in order for this to happen we need verified roles. To contribute you need the role of the investor. The role-verifier which will be tied to ID verification check if your an investor. This will be in the future connected to a DID system and KYC. The role-verifiers will be appointed through sudo for now in this milestone. |  


### Milestone 2  — Onboarding a house (asset)

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains 1. How a seller can onboard a house. 2. How a seller can delegate the rights of selling to a real-estate agent, plus commission setting. 3. The required documents, price setting and deposit required. 
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. Also there will be integration tests covering the pallets and modules of milestone 1. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains the onboarding module, governance structure for onboarding a house and flows that are possible. 
| 1. | **pallet-onboarding** | The asset will be a unique asset, for this the `pallet-uniques` will be used. The additional functionalities we will extend from the unique asset is that we add fracationalizing functionality on top of it. The asset needs to fractionalize after a sale is concluded to the new owners. Furthermore we will set a deposit mechanism for the onboarding party so if their are any 
| 2. | **pallet-voting**| We will create a pallet on top the frame pallets  module (//TODO Need more research exactly which frame-pallet we will build on) that will create new voting mechanims to onboard a house. The housing-council will be very much the first line of defence and it's structure and selection is very similar to the council as we know from kusama/polkadot. The housing council will be able to asses an asset and approve, reject, request more info. These function needs to be changed for the voting that comes from the housing council.  When approved the asset can continue to the investor voting. The investors are set by role and we want them to vote on wether an asset is worthy of investing, the investors don't know with certainty that their capital will be allocated on the house their voting. The selection of the investors will be for above a certain amount  |  
| 3. | Substrate chain | Pallets **onboarding** and **voting** give us the full functionality of onboarding assets while on-chain governance by the housing council act as a 2-step due diligence. The steps from milestone 1 will also be upgraded with this as we need new roles for council members. |

- We intend to bring-up a live testnet with an interface in which everyone can use the solution. Setting roles will be publicly available and we will be monitoring the chain to see if we can assist and verify users. 
-  

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it. //TODO expand on this.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** We have been around in the ecosystem for some time and we knew from the W3F grants program from the beginning it started. 

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done?
  - We have all finished most of the substrate.dev tutorials and guides that are available. We are well aware of all the tools and support places we can ask. 
  - Since the amsterDOT some teams such as Acala have offered to also support technically and other ways. Before the amsterDot we were in talks with Litentry for the DID programme, this resulted in a technical chat with their runtime engineers that we can get technical support from, but the application is not continuing anymore because of a change in their structure. 
  - We are in talks with municipalities in the Netherlands to build towards a case. 
 - We have applied for two EU grants in the past through the f6s platform, but those resulted in nothing.
